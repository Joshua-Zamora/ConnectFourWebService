# Brief Overview:
This program operates as the brain for a connext four game. All computations necessary for client-server interaction are processed through three main files in this project: `new/index`, `play/index`, and `info/index`.
# How to run the program: 
The jar client, `src/c4Client.jar` is used to play the game. Once in the client, enter a valid url such as https://cssrvlab01.utep.edu/classes/cs3360/jazamora6. *Note: This mentioned url may not be valid. Also, a vpn must be used for this link.* After inputting a valid url a game can be played by pressing the play button.
